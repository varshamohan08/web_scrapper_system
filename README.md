# Web Scrapper System
This Django project is designed to save and retrieve details of entities from a specified webpage. It uses Django REST framework to create API endpoints and Selenium WebDriver to scrape the webpage for data.
### Features
- Save Entity: `/api/save-entity/` accepts a URL as a parameter, uses Selenium to pull down the page, extracts entities from the page, and stores the extracted data in the `EntitiesMaster` table in a MySQL database.
- Get Entity: `/api/get-entity/` reads the entities from the EntitiesMaster table.
